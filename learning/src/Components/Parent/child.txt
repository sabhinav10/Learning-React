To create a parent child component structur,we need to first break down our JSX content into small chink and make functional components for each chunk.
In the end ,wrapping each component into a single html element and putting it in a single parent component.
Componets can have a parent child relationship with other components where component containing the other components is the parent component and the later the child components.

function ParentComponent(){
    return(
        <ChildComponent1/>
        <ChildComponent2/>
        <ChildComponent3/>
    )
}
